### Set the default behavior for text files (lineendings will be converted by git)
*             text=auto

### Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted to native line endings on checkout.
*.js          text
*.aod         text
*.xml         text
*.svg         text
*.version     text
*.properties  text
*.jrxml       text
*.json        text
*.adoc        text
*.txt         text


### Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout (Example: windows bat file)
*.bat         text eol=crlf

### Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout. (Example: linux .sh script)
*.sh          text eol=lf

### Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png         binary
*.jpg         binary
*.jasper      binary
